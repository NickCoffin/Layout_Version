## Keywords

- Adroid mobile app
- Raspberry pi
- Camera

<!--Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.-->

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a multiple purpose camera that has multiple functions which can adapt to the user's needs depending on the situation. The system will be built using a raspberry pi with camera and microphone attachments. Features include regular camera capturing, thermal mode, night vision mode, sound detection, motion detection, and light detection. The camera will connect to other devices and the cloud via bluetooth and wifi.

## High Level Requirement

<!--Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.-->
The multi purpose camera is a product that can be used in a variety of ways. Essentially, it is a camera that can video record, capture, and livestream that can be used for whatever the user needs it for (ie. baby monitor, car dashcam, door cam, etc.). Using the app, users will initially connect the camera to their device via bluetooth in order to get the camera connected to their wifi. Once the wifi connection is established, the camera will just need to be set up in the right location, and it is good to go. The app can be used to access stored recordings, camera captures, and livestreams. Camera settings can also be modified and viewed in the app. 



## Conceptual Design

<!--Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.-->


## Background

<!--The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.-->
